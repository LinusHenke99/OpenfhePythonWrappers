# NeuralPy
NeuralPY is a library which creates Python wrappers around the [NeuralOFHE](https://github.com/LinusHenke99/NeuralOFHE)
library which in turn uses the [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) in order to implement 
machine learning operators using homomorphic encryption in order to do inference on encrypted data.
